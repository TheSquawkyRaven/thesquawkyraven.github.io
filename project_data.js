                        This is a survival game, where you play as a bait trying to survive getting eaten while on a hook. It has a line tension mechanic that will wake up the fisherman, and a level system to upgrade certain systems. The game also features another biome once the player reaches 80m!
                        The game is not updated since the jam ended, so it is still the result achieved during that time frame. I got #194 overall, and was the best result I have ever got in a game jam.

(Think of Pokemon Go, but instead of pokemons, they are zombies, and they try to eat you) Using Mapbox for the terrain, Google Maps Places API for the lootable locations (Think of Pokestops) and even a population density map (Zombie density), this game interfaces with all of them within Unity Engine.
                        I got an A :)

                        It's inspired by Twitch streams where in some cases viewers can type commands in the chat to change things in the stream. This program does it similarly, and can be used to show text in a different way, and for fun.
                        A lecturer, during online classes, used it in their classes and mainly use it to notify them about new chat messages, since Google Meet chats are easy to miss. Other features like using the timer, randomization etc were also requested and implemented in consequent builds.
                        This serves as a foundation and inspiration to TTS Squawk.
